# Data structures and algorithms course project

## About
The task of the project was to implement algorithms and data structures
for the GUI program. In the program user can add:

- Ways
- Places
- Areas

And search for example:

- Shortest paths between places
- Routes with cycle
- Area-subArea relations

The idea of the project was to implement efficient search-algorithms
and data structures so that the operations above can be executed.

***StudentLib-folder contains the implementations of algorithms and data structures.***
***The content of the CourseLib-folder was provided by the course staff.***
