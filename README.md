# Data structures and algorithms course project

The task of the project was to implemet algorithms and data structures
for the GUI program where user can draw ways, places and areas by
feeding map data into the program. After that user is able to find out
shortest paths between places and/or find out the relations between
areas and their subareas.

NOTE: The graphical user interface of the program and functionalities
related to it were provided by the course staff. I have implemented
the contents of the datastructures.cc file where I implemented search
algorithms and data structures related to map data.
